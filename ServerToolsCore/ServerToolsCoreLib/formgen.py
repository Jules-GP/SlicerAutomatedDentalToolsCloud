"""Builds Qt widgets from a server tool's argument schema, and reads them back.

Imports neither `requests` nor anything HTTP — see ARCHITECTURE.md dependency
rule. The server is the single source of truth for the schema: adding a field
to a tool server-side makes it appear here without touching any module code.

File-type arguments (any type accepted by `is_file_type` — "file", "zip_file",
"nifti_file", ...) are skipped by build()/collect(): they are not generic
scalar fields, they get their own row in base_widget's "Inputs" section. The
*widget* for such an input is still built here (`file_widget`), so that every
"schema shape -> Qt widget" decision lives in one file.

So is the translation from the server's vocabulary to the one base_widget acts
on — `file_input_modes`, `auto_file_mode`, `result_kind_for` — for the same
reason: it is all "what does the schema say this panel should be". A module
then declares only what the schema *cannot* say (see file_input_modes).

Some schema types render as several widgets rather than one, so they get a
small Python holder class each (`MultiChoiceGroup`, `FileOrFolderInput`,
`JoystickInput`) instead of a QWidget subclass: PythonQt makes subclassing
awkward, and everything the rest of this module needs fits in a plain object
exposing `container` for layout. The one genuine QWidget subclass, the
joystick pad itself, lives in joystick.py.

Escape hatch: a hand-written .ui can still be used by giving its widgets a Qt
dynamic property named "serverArgName" matching the schema argument name —
collect() will pick them up as if they had been generated. Not used by
SurgMovPred; documented for future modules that need custom layout.

    extracts it, and strips a lone root directory if there is one — so whether

    filter, only the `.csv` selections of a file/folder/file/xlsx sequence
    notify; filter order changes nothing). The Apply button would then never

    local file or folder to upload, one of the TEST FILES the server hosts for
    this tool, or a scalar volume already OPEN in the scene (any argument
    `accepts_volume` says yes to).

    Everything sits on ONE line, [sources dropdown][path field + browse], and
    the dropdown is the single place a tool's test data is reached from. There
    used to be two: this list, which sent the hosted NAME and left the file on
    the server, and a separate "Test data" button fetching a hardcoded GitHub
    release URL four modules declared by hand. They answered the same question
    differently, and only one of them put the scan where a clinician could
    open it beside the panel.

    The dropdown's entries, in order: the prompt, the hosted test files (each
    labelled with its kind and size, see `hosted_entry_label`), then the open
    volumes (fed by base_widget; formgen never touches the MRML scene). Which
    kind is selected is decided by INDEX (`_selection`), never by parsing the
    text back, so a hosted file whose name happens to start with the volume
    prefix cannot be misread.

    **Picking a hosted TEST FILE is an action, not a state.** It hands the name
    to the callback base_widget registers (`setHostedCallback`), which
    downloads the file and writes the local path back through `set_local_path`
    - at which point the row holds an ordinary local path like any other, the
    combo returns to its prompt, and the run uploads it. Nothing travels as a
    bare name: the file the user asked to see is on their disk, and a file on
    disk is uploaded.

    Two entries are still a state, for the same reason - there is no local path
    to write. An OPEN VOLUME is exported at upload time
    (base_widget._prepareOneInputFile). A hosted MODEL (`hosted_downloads`
    False, ASO's `reference`) is not downloadable at all - the server declines
    to stream weights, which are selected by name and used in place - so it is
    read back by `server_name()` and sent as a plain form value.

    The sources are kept mutually exclusive by clearing the other one, not by
    letting one silently win: picking a dropdown entry empties the path field,
    and typing/browsing a path resets the dropdown. A precedence rule the user
    cannot see is how you end up uploading a file you thought you had replaced.

    Rebuilding the dropdown (`setChoices`/`setVolumeChoices`) preserves the
    current selection by text when it is still offered: both lists are
    refreshed on every `enter()`, and a refresh must not silently reset a
    chosen entry to the first one in the list.
